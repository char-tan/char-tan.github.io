Hi there! I'm a DPhil Computer Science student at the University of Oxford.
My research is in the area of geometric deep learning, and is supervised by Prof. Michael Bronstein.

<!-- what are you interested in / working on? -->

Prior to Oxford, I studied the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the Universtiy of Cambridge, graduating with distinction.
Whilst in Cambridge my research focused on theories of generalisation within deep learning, and was supervsied by Dr Ferenc Husz√°r.
My MPhil dissertation concerned approximate second-order optimisation, and the subsequent influence on generalisation error.
