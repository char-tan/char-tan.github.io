Hi there! I'm Charlie, a DPhil Computer Science student at the University of Oxford.
My research is in the area of geometric deep learning, and is supervised by Prof. Michael Bronstein.

Prior to Oxford, I studied the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction.
Whilst in Cambridge my research focused on deep learning theory, and was supervised by [Dr Ferenc Husz√°r](https://www.inference.vc/).
I was particularly interested in [geometric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12666) and [topological](/assets/pdf/Persistent Homology Dimension Does Not Measure Generalisation.pdf) theories of generalisation.
My [MPhil dissertation](/assets/pdf/Rethinking Proximal Optimisation for Deep Learning.pdf) concerned approximate second-order optimisation, and the bias of such optimisers towards generalisation.
